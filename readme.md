# Langraph Agent Project

This project implements a Langraph agent with file operation capabilities.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

- **On Windows:**

  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **On macOS and Linux:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Python Modules

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Project

After installing the dependencies, you can run the main application using the `cli.py` file:

```bash
python cli.py
```

This will start the Langraph agent.

### 5. Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When you are done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```
